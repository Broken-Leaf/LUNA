Luna : Let's break this problem down step by step, Sir!
Since the mass of the aluminium rod varies directly with its length, we can set up a proportionality relationship:
Mass ∝ Length
We can convert this to an equation by introducing a constant of proportionality, k:
Mass = k × Length
We're given that a 16 cm long rod has a mass of 192 grams. We can plug these values into the equation to find the value of k:
192 = k × 16
To find k, we can divide both sides by 16:
k = 192 ÷ 16
k = 12
Now that we have the value of k, we can use it to find the length of the rod whose mass is 105 kg. First, let's convert the mass from kilograms to grams:
105 kg = 105 × 1000 = 105,000 grams
Now we can plug this value into our equation:
105,000 = 12 × Length
To find the length, we can divide both sides by 12:
Length = 105,000 ÷ 12
Length = 8750 cm
To convert this length from centimeters to meters, we can divide by 100:
Length = 8750 cm ÷ 100
Length = 87.5 m
So, the length of the rod whose mass is 105 kg is approximately 87.5 meters, Sir!
