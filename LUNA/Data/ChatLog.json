We can plug these values into the equation to find the value of k:\n\n192 = k \u00d7 16\n\nTo find k, we can divide both sides by 16:\n\nk = 192 \u00f7 16\nk = 12\n\nNow that we have the value of k, we can use it to find the length of the rod whose mass is 105 kg. First, let's convert the mass from kilograms to grams:\n\n105 kg = 105 \u00d7 1000 = 105,000 grams\n\nNow we can plug this value into our equation:\n\n105,000 = 12 \u00d7 Length\n\nTo find the length, we can divide both sides by 12:\n\nLength = 105,000 \u00f7 12\nLength = 8750 cm\n\nTo convert this length from centimeters to meters, we can divide by 100:\n\nLength = 8750 cm \u00f7 100\nLength = 87.5 m\n\nSo, the length of the rod whose mass is 105 kg is approximately 87.5 meters, Sir!"
